# Overview
The software I created is text game that allows the user to type in responses with the purpose of escaping a prison cell and the person or persons who trapped you here. I wrote this softwar is because I wanted to see what I could create using what I learned in Java tutorials to make something of my own.

# Development Environment
I used the IntelliJ coding software system to code my Java language and the website to for learning the basics of programming with Java.

# Useful Websites
* (https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp

# Future Work
* The game is a bit slow when running sometimes and I want to make it faster at loading things up.

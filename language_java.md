# Overview
The software I created was a series of different sample codes that where provided by a Java tutorial that I put into my computer for the purpose of testing and experimenting with. Each of the files contains different types of code used for coding with Java. These files demonstrate the following:
* Variables
* Expressions
* Conditionals
* Loops
* Functions
* Classes
The reason I wrote this softwar is because I wanted to learn the basics of programming with Java. Most of my time I have learn only Python in my classes at BYU Idaho and I thought it would be a good idea to learn some new programming languages as well.

# Development Environment
I used the IntelliJ coding software system to code my Java language and the website to for learning the basics of programming with Java.

# Useful Websites
* (https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp
\
# Future Work
* I never really got the chance to go further into the tutorial and would like to learn more eventually.
